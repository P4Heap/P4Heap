# P4Heap
we propose the first approximate heap (called P4Heap) for switch data plane, which firstly track heavy flows on the data plane without recirculation or incurring error on combined sketches. This repo contains P4 implementation and CPU simulation of P4Heap, which reside in CPU and P4 directory, respectively.
